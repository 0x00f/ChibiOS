  /* A very simple exception handler. Does not support preemption since does not save all regs.
   * MIPS context is pretty heavyweight, so try to make it as simple as possible here. Exceptions are disabled.
   * ISR should be very lightweight and return quickly. All the other job should be done out of exception context.
   * That's the point of RTOS, isn't it =)? Also it's possible to run out of stack ...
